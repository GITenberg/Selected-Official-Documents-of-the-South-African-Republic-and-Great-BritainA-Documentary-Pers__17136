<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The universal interest in the affairs of the South African Republic is
responsible for the idea that a selection of documents illustrative of
the South African controversy will be appreciated by American readers.
The documents which are here reprinted are by no means unobtainable;
but, to the general reader, they have been hitherto quite inaccessible.
Only the largest public libraries have the proper sources of
information, and even with these books at hand the student has been
forced to delve in a mass of irrelevant material for the hidden object
of his desire.</p>

<p>The present compilation has been made in the hope of meeting the
immediate demands of the public. To avoid cumbersomeness, many important
documents have necessarily been omitted; yet as far as possible, the
editors have given a complete series of documents. The arrangement is
partly chronological, and we hope altogether logical. Commencing with
the London Convention of 1884, which defines the status of the South
African Republic in its relations with Great Britain, we follow with the
revised Constitution of 1889, and its complementary law of June 23,
1890, which granted representation in a second Volksraad to burghers of
two years' standing. The latest legislation concerning the right of
franchise is given in the enactment of July, 1899. This law, together
with negotiations looking toward further concessions to the Uitlander
population forms the subject of our third chapter. No agreement having
been reached, and numerous complications having arisen, conspicuously
the movements of British troops, the Ultimatum of President Kruger on
October 9, precipitated a state of war.</p>

<p>In presenting this Ultimatum President Kruger knew that the Republic
would not have to fight alone, but that there would be practically a war
of the South African Dutch against the English. The declaration of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Orange Free State to Great Britain will therefore be of interest, as
expressing the grounds of sympathy between the South African Republic
and the Orange Free State, and the latter's view of the <i>causa belli</i>.
Lastly we add the constitution of the Orange Free State that the
political status of the two republics may be appreciated by comparison
of their constitutions.</p>

<p>The documents have been compiled from the <i>Codex van de Locale Wetten
der Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek. Gr&ouml;ningen, 1894</i>; <i>The Political Laws
of the South African Republic. London and Cape Town, 1896</i>; and the
<i>State Papers of Great Britain, London, 1884-99</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Convention of London</span>, <i>February 27, 1884</i>.</h3>

<h4><i>A Convention Between Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland and the South African Republic.</i></h4>


<p>Whereas, The Government of the Transvaal State, through its Delegates,
consisting of Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger, President of the said
State, Stephanus Jacobus Du Toit, Superintendent of Education, and
Nicholas Jacobus Smit, a member of the Volksraad, have represented that
the Convention signed at Pretoria on the 3rd day of August 1881, and
ratified by the Volksraad of the said State on the 25th October 1881,
contains certain provisions which are inconvenient, and imposes burdens
and obligations from which the said State is desirous to be relieved,
and that the southwestern boundaries fixed by the said Convention should
be amended, with a view to promote the peace and good order of the said
State, and of the countries adjacent thereto; and whereas, Her Majesty
the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, has been
pleased to take the said representations into consideration: Now,
therefore, Her Majesty has been pleased to direct, and it is hereby
declared, that the following articles of a new Convention, signed on
behalf of Her Majesty by Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South
Africa, the Right Honorable Sir Hercules George Robert Robinson, Knight
Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint
George, Governor of the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope, and on behalf
of the Transvaal State (which shall hereinafter be called the South
African Republic) by the above named Delegates, Stephanus Johannes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Paulus Kruger, Stephanus Jacobus Du Toit, and Nicholas Jacobus Smit,
shall, when ratified by the Volksraad of the South African Republic, be
substituted for the articles embodied in the Convention of 3rd August
1881; which latter, pending such ratification, shall continue in full
force and effect.</p>


<h4>ARTICLES.</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> I, II.</p>

<p>(Articles I and II relate entirely to the settlement of the boundary
lines of the Republic.)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> III.</p>

<p>If a British officer is appointed to reside at Pretoria or elsewhere
within the South African Republic to discharge functions analogous to
those of a Consular officer, he will receive the protection and
assistance of the Republic.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> IV.</p>

<p>The South African Republic will conclude no treaty or engagement with
any State or nation other than the Orange Free State, nor with any
native tribe to the eastward or westward of the Republic, until the same
has been approved by Her Majesty the Queen.</p>

<p>Such approval shall be considered to have been granted if Her Majesty's
Government shall not, within six months after receiving a copy of such
treaty (which shall be delivered to them immediately upon its
completion), have notified that the conclusion of such treaty is in
conflict with the interests of Great Britain or any of Her Majesty's
possessions in South Africa.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> V.</p>

<p>The South African Republic will be liable for any balance which may
still remain due of the debts for which it was liable at the date of
Annexation, to wit, the Cape Commercial Bank Loan, the Railway Loan, and
the Orphan Chamber Debt, which debts shall be a first charge upon the
revenues of the Republic. The South African Republic will moreover be
liable to Her Majesty's Government for &pound;250,000, which will be a second
charge upon the revenues of the Republic.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> VI.</p>

<p>The debt due as aforesaid by the South African Republic to Her Majesty's
Government will bear interest at the rate of three and a half per cent.
from the date of the ratification of this Convention, and shall be
repayable by a payment for interest and Sinking Fund of six pounds and
nine pence per &pound;100 per annum, which will extinguish the debt in
twenty-five years. The said payment of six pounds and nine pence per
&pound;100 shall be payable half yearly, in British currency, at the close of
each half year from the date of such ratification: <i>Provided always</i>,
That the South African Republic shall be at liberty at the close of any
half-year to pay off the whole or any portion of the outstanding debt.</p>

<p>Interest at the rate of three and a half per cent. on the debt as
standing under the Convention of Pretoria shall as heretofore be paid to
the date of the ratification of this Convention.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> VII.</p>

<p>All persons who held property in the Transvaal on the 8th day of August
1881, and still hold the same, will continue to enjoy the rights of
property which they have enjoyed since the 12th April 1877. No person
who has remained loyal to Her Majesty during the late hostilities shall
suffer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> any molestation by reason of his loyalty; or be liable to any
criminal prosecution or civil action for any part taken in connection
with such hostilities; and all such persons will have full liberty to
reside in the country, with enjoyment of all civil rights, and
protection for their persons and property.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> VIII.</p>

<p>The South African Republic renews the declaration made in the Sand River
Convention, and in the Convention of Pretoria, that no slavery or
apprenticeship partaking of slavery will be tolerated by the Government
of the said Republic.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> IX.</p>

<p>There will continue to be complete freedom of religion and protection
from molestation for all denominations, provided the same be not
inconsistent with morality and good order; and no disability shall
attach to any person in regard to rights of property by reason of the
religious opinions which he holds.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> X.</p>

<p>The British Officer appointed to reside in the South African Republic
will receive every assistance from the Government of the said Republic
in making due provision for the proper care and preservation of the
graves of such of Her Majesty's Forces as have died in the Transvaal;
and if need be, for the appropriation of land for the purpose.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> XI.</p>

<p>All grants or titles issued at any time by the Transvaal Government in
respect of land outside the boundary of the South African Republic, as
defined in Article I, shall be considered invalid and of no effect,
except in so far as any such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> grant or title relates to land that falls
within the boundary of the South African Republic; and all persons
holding any such grant so considered invalid and of no effect will
receive from the Government of the South African Republic such
compensation, either in land or in money, as the Volksraad shall
determine. In all cases in which any Native Chiefs or other authorities
outside the said boundaries have received any adequate consideration
from the Government of the South African Republic for land excluded from
the Transvaal by the first Article of this Convention, or where
permanent improvements have been made on the land, the High Commissioner
will recover from the native authorities fair compensation for the loss
of the land thus excluded, or of the permanent improvements thereon.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> XII.</p>

<p>The independence of the Swazis, within the boundary line of Swaziland,
as indicated in the first Article of this Convention, will be fully
recognized.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> XIII.</p>

<p>Except in pursuance of any treaty or engagement made as provided in
Article IV of this Convention, no other or higher duties shall be
imposed on the importation into the South African Republic of any
article coming from any part of Her Majesty's dominions than are or may
be imposed on the like article coming from any other place or country;
nor will any prohibition be maintained or imposed on the importation
into the South African Republic of any article coming from any part of
Her Majesty's dominions which shall not equally extend to the like
article coming from any other place or country. And in like manner the
same treatment shall be given to any article coming to Great Britain
from the South<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> African Republic as to the like article coming from any
other place or country.</p>

<p>These provisions do not preclude the consideration of special
arrangements as to import duties and commercial relations between the
South African Republic and any of Her Majesty's colonies or possessions.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> XIV.</p>

<p>All persons, other than natives, conforming themselves to the laws of
the South African Republic (<i>a</i>) will have full liberty, with their
families, to enter, travel, or reside in any part of the South African
Republic; (<i>b</i>) they will be entitled to hire or possess houses,
manufactories, warehouses, shops and premises; (<i>c</i>) they may carry on
their commerce either in person or by any agents whom they may think fit
to employ; (<i>d</i>) they will not be subject, in respect of their persons
or property, or in respect of their commerce or industry, to any taxes,
whether general or local, other than those which are or may be imposed
upon citizens of the said Republic.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> XV.</p>

<p>All persons, other than natives, who establish their domicile in the
Transvaal between the 12th day of April 1877, and the 8th August 1881,
and who within twelve months after such last mentioned date have had
their names registered by the British Resident, shall be exempt from all
compulsory military service whatever.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> XVI.</p>

<p>Provision shall hereafter be made by a separate instrument for the
mutual extradition of criminals, and also for the surrender of deserters
from Her Majesty's Forces.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> XVII.</p>

<p>All debts contracted between the 12th April 1877 and the 8th August 1881
will be payable in the same currency in which they may have been
contracted.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> XVIII.</p>

<p>No grants of land which may have been made, and no transfers or
mortgages which may have been passed between the 12th April 1877 and the
8th August 1881, will be invalidated by reason merely of their having
been made or passed between such dates.</p>

<p>All transfers to the British Secretary for Native Affairs in trust for
Natives will remain in force, an officer of the South African Republic
taking the place of such Secretary for Native Affairs.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> XIX.</p>

<p>The Government of the South African Republic will engage faithfully to
fulfil the assurances given, in accordance with the laws of the South
African Republic, to the natives at the Pretoria Pitso by the Royal
Commission in the presence of the Triumvirate and with their entire
assent, (1) as to the freedom of the natives to buy or otherwise acquire
land under certain conditions, (2) as to the appointment of a commission
to mark out native locations, (3) as to the access of the natives to the
courts of law, and (4) as to their being allowed to move freely within
the country, or to leave it for any legal purpose, under a pass system.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article</span> XX.</p>

<p>This Convention will be ratified by a Volksraad of the South African
Republic within the period of six months<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> after its execution, and in
default of such ratification this Convention shall be null and void.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ratification by Volksraad</span>.</h3>

<p class="right"><i>August 8, 1884.</i></p>

<p>The Convention was ratified on August 8, 1884 by the Volksraad in a
resolution as follows: "The Volksraad having considered the new
Convention concluded between its deputation and the British Government
at London on 27th February 1884, as likewise the negotiations between
the contracting parties, which resulted in the said Convention, approves
of the standpoint taken by its deputation that a settlement based upon
the principle of the Sand River Convention can alone fully satisfy the
burghers of the Republic. It also shares the objections set forth by the
deputation against the Convention of Pretoria, as likewise their
objections against the Convention of London on the following points:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1st. The settlement of the boundary, especially on the western border
of the Republic, in which the deputation eventually acquiesced only
under the express conditions with which the Raad agree.</p>

<p>"2nd. The right of veto reserved to the British Crown upon treaties to
be concluded by the Republic with foreign powers; and</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>FULL TEXT OF THE FRANCHISE LAW. PUBLISHED JULY 26, 1899. LAW NO. 3.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, It has appeared desirable to amend and amplify certain
provisions of the laws with reference to naturalization and the
obtaining of the full franchise; and</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, These amendments will not permit of delay by being
published three months beforehand in terms of Article 12 of the
Grondwet, and as they have already been accepted by the people in
principle; it is hereby enacted that:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 1.&mdash;Each white male stranger, who has reached the age
of sixteen years, and who settles or has settled in the South African
Republic with the intention of residing there, shall in future be able
to obtain letters of naturalization, provided that he fulfills the
following provisions and enactments&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The applicant shall produce a certificate from the Field-Cornet
and the Landrost of his ward and district, countersigned by the
Commandant of the district, to show that he was, during the
time&mdash;required in his case&mdash;preceding the naturalization, continually
registered on the Field-Cornet's list; was during this time domiciled in
the South African Republic; and during this time obeyed the laws of the
land and committed no crime against the independence of the South
African Republic.</p>

<p>If the Field-Cornet and Landrost are not from their personal knowledge
able to grant such certificate, they shall do so on the strength of
affidavits of the applicant and two well known, fully enfranchised
burghers of the ward and district, declaring that the applicant has,
during the necessary period,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> been domiciled in the South African
Republic, and has during that time obeyed the laws of the land, and has
committed no crime against the independence of the South African
Republic.</p>

<p>If the Field-Cornet and Landrost and Commandant refuse to grant such
certificate or to sign it, the applicant may appeal to the Executive
Council.</p>

<p>If the Field-Cornet's books are destroyed or lost the applicant shall
prove to the satisfaction of the State Secretary and State Attorney, by
means of affidavits, that he was registered.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The applicant shall produce a sworn declaration made by himself to
the effect that he has had no dishonouring sentence passed on him, and
shall produce further proof of good behavior.</p>

<p>By dishonouring sentence shall be understood a sentence for the crimes
of high treason, murder, rape, theft, fraud, perjury, or forgery.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The applicant shall produce proof that he possesses unmortgaged
fixed property to the value of &pound;150, or pays rent to the amount of &pound;50
per annum, or draws a fixed salary or wage of &pound;100 per annum, or makes
an independent living by farming or cattle-breeding.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The person desiring to be naturalized shall, before the official
granting of the letters of naturalization, take the following oath, by
which he will be understood to renounce and give up all burgher rights
enjoyed in and burgher duties and subjection to any State or ruler:</p>

<p>"I swear (or I solemnly declare that the taking of an oath is not
permitted by my religion, and promise), faithfully in all righteousness,
and in terms of Law No. ____, of 1899, with which I declare to be
acquainted, that I shall be loyal to this State, shall honour and
support its inde<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>pendence, shall subject myself to the Grondwet and the
lawful authorities of the land, and shall in all respects conduct myself
as it behooves a loyal burgher of this State. So truly help me God&mdash;or
that I solemnly promise."</p>

<p>Before a person who has already been naturalized is admitted to the full
franchise, he shall, when he makes application therefor, besides
fulfilling the other requirements of this Law, again produce proof of
fulfilment of the provisions and enactments of Sections <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and
<i>c</i>.</p>

<p>No person shall be entitled to or be allowed to obtain letters of
naturalization or full franchise unless he has fulfilled the
aforementioned provisions, with the exception of cases for which this or
any other Law makes special provision.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 2.&mdash;Each person who comes or has come to the South
African Republic to stay shall, after at least two years, and after
fulfillment of the provisions of Article 1, be able to obtain letters of
naturalization, and shall, at least five years after naturalization, be
able to obtain the full franchise, provided that in both instances, six
months before the expiration of the fixed period, he gives written
notice of his intention to apply therefor to the State Secretary through
the Field-Cornet and Landrost of his ward and district.</p>

<p>The Field-Cornet shall be bound, under pain of a fine of not more than
&pound;10 in each case of neglect, to send this notice to the State Secretary
through the Landrost as soon as possible, and at the most within thirty
days of the sending in thereof, for publication in the <i>Staats Courant</i>
for general information, and the State Secretary shall without loss of
time publish such notice three consecutive times in the <i>Staats
Courant</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 3.&mdash;Each person who comes or has come into the South
African Republic to stay shall, at least seven years after sending in to
the Field-Cornet a notice of his intention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> to be naturalized, in
accordance with the form contained in Schedule A, be able to obtain
letters of naturalization with the full franchise on fulfilling the
provisions of Article 1.</p>

<p>Such notice shall be sent by the Field-Cornet to the State Secretary and
be published by him, all under the same provision and punishment as set
forth in the foregoing article.</p>

<p>If the person desires to obtain letters of naturalization with full
franchise after seven years, he shall also, at least six months before
the expiration of the period, give written notice to the State
Secretary, the Field-Cornet and Landrost of his ward and district.</p>

<p>This notice shall also be sent to the State Secretary by the
Field-Cornet, and the latter shall publish it in the <i>Staats Courant</i>,
all under the same provision and punishment as set forth in Article 2.</p>

<p>The applicant shall then, on application for the letters of
naturalization with full franchise, further give proof that he has sent
in the notice, in accordance with the form of Schedule A, mentioned in
the first paragraph of this article, for proof of which it will be
sufficient to produce a copy of the <i>Staats Courant</i> in which the notice
was published.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 4.&mdash;Each person who has come to the South African
Republic to stay before the coming into force of this Law shall, on
fulfilment of the provisions of Article 1, be able to obtain letters of
naturalization at least seven years after his coming into the country.</p>

<p>In case the applicant is not entitled to the full franchise six months
after the coming into force of this Law, he shall give proof that he,
within six months after the coming into force of the Law sent to the
Field-Cornet of his ward a written notice of his intention to become
naturalized.</p>

<p>If he neglect to send in this notice, in accordance with the form
contained in Schedule A, or if he does not produce the certificate
mentioned in Article 1, Section <i>a</i>, the applicant shall not be entitled
to the full franchise in terms of this Article, but only in terms of
Articles 2 and 3.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Such notice shall be sent by the Field-Cornet to the State Secretary,
and the latter shall publish the same in the <i>Staats Courant</i>, all under
the same provisions and punishment as set forth in Article 2.</p>

<p>If he is naturalized after this Law comes into force, he may obtain the
full franchise after five years from the date of his naturalization,
and, if he chooses, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of
this Article.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 5.&mdash;Nothing provided in this Law shall prevent the
Executive Council from granting letters of naturalization with or
without the full franchise to persons who take a position in the service
of the country, or have rendered services to the country, or who have in
any other respect rendered themselves of service to the country,
although in their case they have not fulfilled the provisions of the Law
provided that they take the oath in accordance with Article 1.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 6.&mdash;Youths not born in the State, and whose fathers
have obtained letters of naturalization or full franchise before they
(the youth) had reached the age of sixteen years, have the same
franchise as their father.</p>

<p>Youths born in this State, whose fathers were neither naturalized nor
had the full franchise, may be naturalized at their sixteenth year by
taking the oath mentioned in Article 1, and may, five years after that,
obtain the full franchise by fulfilling the provisions mentioned in
Article 1, Sections <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. They shall also, on their sixteenth
year, by giving notice as contained in Schedule A, be able to obtain the
full franchise five years thereafter, on fulfillment of the provisions
contained in Article 1, Sections <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>d</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 7.&mdash;The application for naturalization and the full
franchise must be sent with the necessary proofs to the State Secretary
by the Field-Cornet, through the Landrost, and the latter shall refer
these to the State Attorney, who shall send them back to the State
Secretary with his advice. If the State Secretary and State Attorney
have no legal objection to the granting of the letter of naturalization
or full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> franchise, then this shall be granted. If there is any
objection, the Executive Council shall decide.</p>

<p>The letters of naturalization and full franchise shall be signed by the
State Secretary and State Attorney. The State Secretary shall cause the
letters of naturalization and full franchise to be granted by an
official appointed for that purpose, and cause the necessary oath of
naturalization to be taken before this official.</p>

<p>The letters of naturalization shall bear a stamp of &pound;2 sterling; the
granting of the full franchise to persons who are already naturalized
shall be free of cost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 8.&mdash;No person who is not considered as a white
inhabitant of the South African Republic shall obtain the franchise, in
accordance with Article 9 of the Grondwet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 9.&mdash;All laws and provisions, in so far as they are in
conflict with this Law, are hereby repealed.</p>

<h3>PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS.</h3>

<h4>PROPOSAL OF GREAT BRITAIN FOR A JOINT INQUIRY.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>British Agent to South African Republic, August 2, 1899.</i></p>

<p>Her Majesty's Government authorize me to invite President of South
African Republic to appoint delegates to discuss with delegates to be
appointed by me on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, whether Uitlander
population will be given immediate and substantial representation by
franchise law recently passed by Volksraad, together with other measures
connected with it, such as increase of seats, and, if not, what
additions or alterations may be necessary to secure that result. In this
discussion it should be understood that the delegates of Her Majesty's
Government would be free to make any suggestions calculated to improve
measures in question and secure their attaining the end desired.
Personally I wish to add the expression of my earnest hope that
Government of South African Republic may accept this proposal, and that
we may proceed to discuss the composition of the proposed Commission,
method of procedure, and place of meeting, at once. Government of South
African Republic will, I feel sure, agree with me that, if proposal of
Her Majesty's Government is accepted, the inquiry should be held as soon
as possible.</p>


<h4>ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>F.W. Reitz to British Agent.</i></p>

<p class="right"><i>19th August.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir</i>, With reference to your proposal for a joint enquiry in your
dispatches of the 2nd and 3rd August, Government of South African
Republic have the honour to suggest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> the following alternative proposal
for consideration of Her Majesty's Government, which this Government
trusts may lead to a final settlement: (1) The Government are willing to
recommend to the Volksraad and the people a 5 years' retrospective
franchise, as proposed by His Excellency the High Commissioner on the
1st June, 1899. (2) The Government are further willing to recommend to
the Volksraad that 8 new seats in the First Volksraad, and, if
necessary, also in the Second Volksraad, be given to the population of
the Witwatersrand, thus with the 2 sitting members for the Goldfields,
giving to the population thereof 10 representatives in a Raad of 36, and
in future the representation of the Goldfields of this Republic shall
not fall below the proportion of one-fourth of the total. (3) The new
burghers shall equally with the old burghers be entitled to vote at the
election for State President and Commandant-General. (4) This Government
will always be prepared to take into consideration such friendly
suggestions regarding the details of the Franchise Law as Her Majesty's
Government, through the British Agent, may wish to convey to it. (5) In
putting forward the above proposals Government of South African Republic
assumes: (<i>a</i>) That Her Majesty's Government will agree that the present
intervention shall not form a precedent for future similar action and
that in the future no interference in the internal affairs of the
Republic will take place. (<i>b</i>) That Her Majesty's Government will not
further insist on the assertion of the suzerainty, the controversy on
the subject being allowed tacitly to drop. (<i>c</i>) That arbitration (from
which foreign element other than Orange Free State is to be excluded)
will be conceded as soon as the franchise scheme has become law. (6)
Immediately on Her Majesty's Government accepting this proposal for a
settlement, the Government will ask the Volksraad to adjourn for the
purpose of consulting the people about it, and the whole scheme might
become law say within a few weeks. (7) In the meantime the form and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
scope of the proposed Tribunal are also to be discussed and
provisionally agreed upon, while the franchise scheme is being referred
to the people, so that no time may be lost in putting an end to the
present state of affairs. The Government trust that Her Majesty's
Government will clearly understand that in the opinion of this
Government the existing franchise law of this Republic is both fair and
liberal to the new population, and that the consideration that induces
them to go further, as they do in the above proposals, is their strong
desire to get the controversies between the two Governments settled, and
further to put an end to present strained relations between the two
Governments and the incalculable harm and loss it has already occasioned
in South Africa, and to prevent a racial war from the effects of which
South Africa may not recover for many generations, perhaps never at all,
and therefore this Government, having regard to all these circumstances
would highly appreciate it if Her Majesty's Government, seeing the
necessity of preventing the present crisis from developing still further
and the urgency of an early termination of the present state of affairs,
would expedite the acceptance or refusal of the settlement here offered.</p>


<p class="right"><i>21st August.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir</i>, In continuation of my dispatch of the 19th instant, and with
reference to the communication to you of the State Attorney this
morning, I wish to forward to you the following in explanation thereof,
with the request that the same may be telegraphed to His Excellency the
High Commissioner for South Africa, as forming part of the proposals of
this Government embodied in the above-named dispatch: (1) The proposals
of this Government regarding question of franchise and representation
contained in that dispatch must be regarded as expressly conditional on
Her Majesty's Government consenting to the points set forth in paragraph
5 of the dispatch, viz.: (<i>a</i>) In future not to interfere in internal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
affairs of the South African Republic. (<i>b</i>) Not to insist further on
its assertion of existence of suzerainty. (<i>c</i>) To agree to arbitration.
(2) Referring to paragraph 6 of the dispatch, this Government trusts
that it is clear to Her Majesty's Government that this Government has
not consulted the Volksraad as to this question and will only do so when
an affirmative reply to its proposals has been received from Her
Majesty's Government.</p>


<h4>NOTE.</h4>

<p>In reply to the above proposals of the South African Republic, the
Secretary of State for the Colonies declared Great Britain "unable to
appreciate the objections entertained by the Government of the South
African Republic to a Joint Commission of Inquiry," and refused to enter
into a consideration of the alternative proposals of the South African
Republic.</p>

<p>As a consequence of this refusal, the South African Republic
communicated to Great Britain that the "proposal for a five years'
franchise and extension of representation of the Witwatersrand with the
conditions attached thereto" had lapsed, whereby also lapsed the
necessity of laying it before the representatives of the people for
ratification.</p>

<p>During the month of September following, the negotiations failed to
produce any agreement, and matters remained in this unsatisfactory state
until, on October 9, 1899, the ultimatum of President Kruger brought
affairs to an actual crisis.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>ULTIMATUM OF SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC, OCTOBER 9, 1899.</h3>


<p>The Government of the South African Republic feels itself compelled to
refer the Government of Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain and
Ireland once more to the Convention of London, 1884, concluded between
this Republic and the United Kingdom and which in its XIVth Article
secures certain specified rights to the white population of this
Republic, namely, that "All persons, other than natives, conforming
themselves to the laws of the South African Republic (<i>a</i>) will have
full liberty, with their families, to enter, travel, or reside in any
part of the South African Republic; (<i>b</i>) they will be entitled to hire
or possess houses, manufactories, warehouses, shops, and premises; (<i>c</i>)
they may carry on their commerce either in person or by any agents whom
they may think fit to employ; (<i>d</i>) they will not be subject, in respect
of their persons or property, or in respect of their commerce or
industry, to any taxes, whether general or local, other than those which
are or may be imposed upon citizens of the said Republic." This
Government wishes further to observe that the above are only rights
which Her Majesty's Government have reserved in the above Convention
with regard to the Uitlander population of this Republic and that the
violation only of those rights could give that Government a right to
diplomatic representations or intervention while, moreover, the
regulation of all other questions affecting the position or the rights
of the Uitlander population under the above-mentioned Convention is
handed over to the Government and the representatives of the people of
the South African Republic. Amongst the questions the regulation of
which falls exclusively within the competence of the Government and of
the Volksraad, are included those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> of the franchise and representation
of the people in this Republic, and although thus the exclusive right of
this Government and of the Volksraad for the regulation of that
franchise and representation is indisputable, yet this Government has
found occasion to discuss in a friendly fashion the franchise and the
representation of the people with Her Majesty's Government, without,
however, recognizing any rights thereto on the part of Her Majesty's
Government. This Government has also, by the formulation of the now
existing Franchise Law and the Resolution with regard to representation,
constantly held these friendly discussions before its eyes. On the part
of Her Majesty's Government, however, the friendly nature of these
discussions has assumed a more and more threatening tone, and the minds
of the people in this Republic and in the whole of South Africa have
been excited and a condition of extreme tension has been created, while
Her Majesty's Government could no longer agree to the legislation
respecting franchise and the Resolution respecting representation in
this Republic, and finally, by your note of 25th September, 1899, broke
off all friendly correspondence on the subject, and intimated that they
must now proceed to formulate their own proposals for a final
settlement, and this Government can only see in the above intimation
from Her Majesty's Government a new violation of the Convention of
London, 1884, which does not reserve to Her Majesty's Government the
right to a unilateral settlement of a question which is exclusively a
domestic one for this Government and has already been regulated by it.</p>

<p>On account of the strained situation and the consequent serious loss in
and interruption of trade in general which the correspondence respecting
the franchise and representation in this Republic carried in its train,
Her Majesty's Government have recently pressed for an early settlement
and finally pressed, by your intervention, for an answer within
forty-eight hours (subsequently somewhat modified) to your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> note of the
12th September, replied to by the note of this Government of the 15th
September, and your note of the 25th September, 1899, and thereafter
further friendly negotiations broke off and this Government received the
intimation that the proposal for a final settlement would shortly be
made, but although this promise was once more repeated no proposal has
up to now reached this Government. Even while friendly correspondence
was still going on an increase of troops on a large scale was introduced
by Her Majesty's Government, and stationed in the neighborhood of the
borders of this Republic. Having regard to occurrences in the history of
this Republic which it is unnecessary here to call to mind, this
Government felt obliged to regard this military force in the
neighborhood of its borders as a threat against the independence of the
South African Republic, since it was aware of no circumstances which
could justify the presence of such military force in South Africa and in
the neighborhood of its borders. In answer to an inquiry with respect
thereto, addressed to His Excellency the High Commissioner, this
Government received, to its great astonishment, in answer, a veiled
insinuation that from the side of the Republic (<i>van Republikeinsche
zyde</i>) an attack was being made on Her Majesty's Colonies and at the
same time a mysterious reference to possibilities whereby it was
strengthened in its suspicion that the independence of this Republic was
being threatened. As a defensive measure it was therefore obliged to
send a portion of the burghers of this Republic in order to offer the
requisite resistance to similar possibilities. Her Majesty's unlawful
intervention in the internal affairs of this Republic in conflict with
the Convention of London, 1884, caused by the extraordinary
strengthening of troops in the neighborhood of the borders of this
Republic, has thus caused an intolerable condition of things to arise
whereto this Government feels itself obliged, in the interest not only
of this Republic but also of all South Africa, to make an end as soon as
possible, and feels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> itself called upon and obliged to press earnestly
and with emphasis for an immediate termination of this state of things
and to request Her Majesty's Government to give it the assurance</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) That all points of mutual difference shall be regulated by the
friendly course of arbitration or by whatever amicable way may be agreed
upon by this Government with Her Majesty's Government.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) That the troops on the borders of this Republic shall be instantly
withdrawn.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) That all reinforcements of troops which have arrived in South
Africa since the 1st June, 1899, shall be removed from South Africa
within a reasonable time, to be agreed upon with this Government, and
with a mutual assurance and guarantee on the part of this Government
that no attack upon or hostilities against any portion of the
possessions of the British Government shall be made by the Republic
during further negotiations within a period of time to be subsequently
agreed upon between the Governments, and this Government will, on
compliance therewith, be prepared to withdraw the armed burghers of this
Republic from the borders.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) That Her Majesty's troops which are now on the high seas shall not
be landed in any port of South Africa.</p>

<p>This Government must press for an immediate and affirmative answer to
these four questions, and earnestly requests Her Majesty's Government to
return such an answer before or upon Wednesday the 11th October, 1899,
not later than 5 o'clock p.m., and it desires further to add that in the
event of unexpectedly no satisfactory answer being received by it within
that interval it will with great regret be compelled to regard the
action of Her Majesty's Government as a formal declaration of war, and
will not hold itself responsible for the consequences thereof, and that
in the event of any further movements of troops taking place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> within the
above-mentioned time in the nearer directions of our borders this
Government will be compelled to regard that also as a formal declaration
of war.</p>


<h4>REPLY OF GREAT BRITAIN.</h4>

<p class="right"><i>October 10, 1899.</i></p>

<p>Her Majesty's Government have received with great regret the peremptory
demands of the Government of the South African Republic conveyed in your
telegram of 9th October, No. 3. You will inform the Government of the
South African Republic, in reply, that the conditions demanded by the
Government of the South African Republic are such as Her Majesty's
Government deem it impossible to discuss.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>DUAL ALLIANCE OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC AND THE ORANGE FREE STATE.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Resolution of Orange Free State, September 27, 1899.</i></p>


<p>The Volksraad, having heard the second paragraph of His Honor's opening
speech and the official documents and correspondence relating thereto
which have been handed in, having regard to the strained state of
affairs in South Africa which have arisen in consequence of the
differences between the Governments of South African Republic and Her
Britannic Majesty, which constitute a threatening danger for bringing
about hostilities, the calamitous effect of which would be incalculable
for all white inhabitants of South Africa, being bound to the South
African Republic by the closest bonds of blood and alliance and standing
in most friendly relations towards Her Majesty's Government, fearing
that should a war break out a hatred would be generated between the
European races in South Africa, which still in the far future will
impede and restrain the peaceful development of all States and Colonies
of South Africa, being sensible that serious obligations rest on the
Volksraad to do all that is possible to prevent the shedding of blood,
considering that in the course of negotiations with the British
Government which have extended over several months, every endeavor has
been made by the Government of the South African Republic at a peaceful
settlement of the differences which have been brought forward by
Uitlanders in the South African Republic and which have been adopted as
its own cause by the Government of Her Majesty, which endeavors,
unfortunately, have only had the result that British troops have been
concentrated on the border of the South African Republic and are still
continually being reinforced:</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Resolves to instruct the Government still further to do everything in
its power to preserve and establish peace and to contribute by peaceful
methods towards the solution of the existing differences, always
provided that it can be brought about without injury to the honour and
independence of this State or of the South African Republic, and wishes
unmistakably to declare its opinion that there exists no cause for war
and that if a war is now begun or occasioned by Her Majesty's Government
against South African Republic, this would morally be a war against the
whole of white population of South Africa and would in its results be
calamitous and criminal; and further, that Orange Free State will
honestly and faithfully observe its obligations towards South African
Republic arising out of the political alliance between the two
Republics, whatever may happen."</p>


<h4>CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND ORANGE FREE STATE.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Sir Alfred Milner to President Steyn, October 11, 1899.</i></p>

<p>In view of resolution of Volksraad of Orange Free State communicated to
me in Your Honour's telegram of 27th September, I have the honour to
request that I may be informed at Your Honour's earliest possible
convenience whether this action on the part of the South African
Republic has Your Honour's concurrence and support.</p>


<p class="center"><i>President of Orange Free State to Sir Alfred Milner, October 11, 1899.</i></p>

<p>I have the honour to acknowledge Your Excellency's telegrams of this
evening. The high-handed and unjustifiable policy and conduct of Her
Majesty's Government in interfering in and dictating in the purely
internal affairs of South African Republic, constituting a flagrant
breach of the Convention of London, 1884, accompanied at first by
prepara<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>tions, and latterly followed by active commencement of
hostilities against that Republic, which no friendly and
well-intentioned efforts on our part could induce Her Majesty's
Government to abandon, constitute such an undoubted and unjust attack on
the independence of the South African Republic that no other course is
left to this State than honourably to abide by its Conventional
Agreements entered into with that Republic. On behalf of this
Government, therefore, I beg to notify that, compelled thereto by the
action of Her Majesty's Government, they intend to carry out the
instructions of the Volksraad as set forth in the last part of the
Resolution referred to by Your Excellency.</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
